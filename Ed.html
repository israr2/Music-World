        <h2>Personal Details:</h2>
        <p>
            Sheeran began recording music in 2004 and independently released his first collection of work, tiled Spinning Man.[A] He has been friends with fellow English singer, Passenger, since he was 15, with the two playing the same gig in Cambridge.[36] He moved to London in 2008 and began playing in small venues. In 2008, he auditioned for the ITV series Britannia High.[37] He also opened for Nizlopi in Norwich in April 2008, after being one of their guitar technicians.[18] In the autumn of 2009, Sheeran began studying music at the Academy of Contemporary Music (ACM) in Guildford, Surrey as an undergraduate at the age 18,[38] but left without permission in the same year to support hip-hop artist Just Jack.[39] He released another EP in 2009, You Need Me, and also collaborated several times with Essex singer Leddra Chapman, including CeeLo Green's "Fuck You". In February 2010, Sheeran posted a video through SB.TV, and rapper Example invited Sheeran to tour with him. In the same month, he also released his critically acclaimed Loose Change EP, which featured his future debut single, "The A Team".[40]

Sheeran began to be seen by more people over the internet through YouTube and his fan base expanded, with him also receiving praise from The Independent newspaper and Elton John.[41] He played a Station Session in St. Pancras International in June 2010.[42][43] Some of the episode is on their Facebook page[44] Sheeran also self-released two other EPs in 2010, Ed Sheeran: Live at the Bedford and Songs I Wrote with Amy, which is a collection of love songs he wrote in Wales with Amy Wadge.[45] When in Los Angeles in 2010, he was invited to perform at The Foxxhole, a club run by actor Jamie Foxx, which ended with an invitation to stay at Foxx's home.[46]

On 8 January 2011, Sheeran released another independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations Project, featuring grime artists such as Wiley, Jme, Devlin, Sway and Ghetts.[47] With this EP, Sheeran gained mainstream attention for having reached number 2 in the iTunes chart without any promotion or label, selling over 7,000 copies in the first week.[48] Three months later, Sheeran put on a free show to fans at the Barfly in Camden Town. Over 1,000 fans turned up, so Sheeran played four different shows to ensure everyone saw a gig, including a gig outside on the street after the venue had closed. Later that month, Sheeran was signed to Asylum Records.[48]

                Aslam began his career after forming the band Jal and released the song 'Aadat' with another contemporary musician Goher Mumtaz in 2003.
