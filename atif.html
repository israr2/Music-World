                Muhammad Atif Aslam (Urdu: محمد عاطف اسلم‎; born 12 March 1983; mostly referred to as Atif Aslam) is a Pakistani playback singer, song-writer, composer and an actor. Best known for his hit songs in the Pakistani and Indian film industries.[1] He has recorded numerous chart-topping songs in both Pakistan and India and is known for his vocal belting technique.[1][2]

He predominantly sings in Urdu and Hindi, but has also sung in Punjabi, Bengali and Pashto. With a number of successful chart-topping songs, he is often considered one of the best playback singers in the Indian and Pakistani music industries of all times.[3][4][5][6] In 2008, Aslam received the Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, the fourth-highest civilian honour award from the Pakistani government. He is also a recipient of a number of Lux Style Awards.[7] Aslam made his acting debut in 2011 with the Urdu social drama film Bol. In 2019, he was awarded a star in the Dubai Walk of Fame after his nomination for the best singer in Pakistan.[8][9][10] He was also featured in the Forbes Asia's 100 Digital Stars, published in December, 2020.[11][12] Aslam has a large fan following in Pakistan as well as in neighbouring countries of India and Bangladesh. He refers to his fans as "Aadeez" (Urdu: عادیز‎, lit. 'Habituals').[13]</p>

        <h2>Personal Details:</h2>
        <p>
            Atif Aslam was born on 12 March 1983[14][15][16] into a Punjabi Muslim family in Wazirabad, Punjab, Pakistan. He went to Kimberley Hall School in Lahore until 1991, when he moved to Rawalpindi and continued his studies at St. Paul's Cambridge School in Satellite Town. In 1995, Aslam returned to Lahore where he continued his studies at a Divisional Public School and College (DPSC) branch. He proceeded to attend Fazaia Inter College for his HSSC from 1999 to 2001, and later went to PICS to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science.[17][18] In an interview, Aslam revealed that his ambition around this time was to become a professional cricketer.[19]        </p>

            <h2>Career Achievements:</h2>
            <p>
                Aslam began his career after forming the band Jal and released the song 'Aadat' with another contemporary musician Goher Mumtaz in 2003. The original version was written by Goher and sung by Aslam. During this initial period of the band, Aslam was the lead singer of Jal. He has mentioned in multiple interviews that he had recorded the song with his pocket money at the age of 17. The band released the song on the internet in 2003, which then went on to become a youth anthem.

                After separation from Jal, Aslam released his first album titled Jal Pari, on 17 July 2004, produced by Sarmad Abdul Ghafoor, having 11 tracks, which was an instant hit.[21][22] The album also won the 4th Lux Style Awards in 2005 in the category of "Best Album".            </p>
